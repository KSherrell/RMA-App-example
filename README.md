# Return Merchandize Authorization Application example
## Description
The RMA Application was created to track the meter traffic in and out of the shop and the work that was performed on each meter, from Receive to Job Complete. We were thinking BIG when we thought of this application, and it is incredibly full-featured, including details such as logging comments to the activity cells and sending detailed Job Complete emails to customers.

This was my very first application for my company ... okay, yes, my very first professional application ever ... it was challenging as hell and I am really pleased with how it turned out. Also, on a personal note, it's fun to look at this and see the evolution of my code. And code comments. : )
